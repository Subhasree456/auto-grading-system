# auto-grading-system

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
   GenAI generates probabilistic outputs based on patterns in training data,lacking true understanding and the ability to make qualitative judgments.

SOLUTION:

	Programming Languages Used: Python
    Grading assignments, essays, and open-ended questions can be a time-consuming task for educators. Generative AI can streamline this process by automatically evaluating student submissions. By training on a large dataset of previously graded assignments, the AI can recognize patterns and provide consistent, reliable grading. This not only saves educators time but also ensures a more impartial evaluation.
